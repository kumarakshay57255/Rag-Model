🚀 Just Built a Dynamic Multi-Source RAG System with LangChain! 🤖

I'm excited to share my latest project - a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that goes beyond traditional PDF-only document processing!

🎯 Key Features:

📁 Multi-Format Support:
• PDF documents
• CSV data files
• JSON documents
• Plain text & Markdown
• Web pages via URL scraping

🌐 Web Scraping Integration:
• Load content from ANY public URL
• Powered by Playwright for robust scraping
• Automatic content extraction and parsing

🧠 Smart AI Features:
• Local embeddings with Xenova Transformers (384D vectors)
• Semantic search with cosine similarity
• Google Gemini 2.5 Flash integration for AI-powered answers
• Query across ALL sources simultaneously

⚡ Technical Stack:
• Backend: Node.js + Express
• LangChain: Community loaders for multiple formats
• Vector Store: Custom JSON-based persistence
• Frontend: Modern tabbed interface with drag-and-drop
• AI: Google Gemini API

💡 Real-World Use Cases:
✅ Combine research papers + Wikipedia articles + datasets
✅ Scrape documentation websites + local markdown files
✅ Query CSV/JSON data using natural language
✅ Build unified knowledge bases from mixed sources

🎨 User Experience:
• Intuitive tabbed interface (File Upload / Load URL)
• Real-time progress tracking
• Support for up to 10MB files
• Cross-source querying with source attribution

📊 Performance:
• Fast local embeddings (no API costs for vectors)
• ~100ms query response time
• 2-5 second AI answer generation
• Handles thousands of document chunks efficiently

🔧 Architecture Highlights:
• RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter (1000 chars, 200 overlap)
• Persistent vector store with metadata tracking
• RESTful API design
• Modular document loaders for extensibility

This project showcases the power of combining multiple data sources into a single, searchable knowledge base. Perfect for research, documentation, and building intelligent Q&A systems!

The system can answer questions like "What are the main concepts of machine learning?" by pulling relevant information from PDFs, web articles, CSV data, and JSON documents - all in one unified response.
